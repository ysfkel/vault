# High Issues

## H-1: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

	```solidity
	contract MockGenericSwapExactAmountIn is IGenericSwapExactAmountIn {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

	        if(!asset.transfer(to, amount)) revert Vault__WithdrawFailed();

## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	    function trade(address swapper, bytes memory tradeData) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused onlyRole(TRADER_ROLE) returns(bytes memory returnData)  {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

</details>



## L-6: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

	```solidity
	        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** 18);
	```

</details>



## L-7: Internal functions called only once can be inlined

Instead of separating the logic into a separate function, consider inlining the logic into the calling function. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve readability.

	```solidity

## L-8: Unused Custom Error

it is recommended that the definition be removed when custom error is unused

## L-9: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.

	```

</details>



## L-10: State variable could be declared immutable

State variables that are should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
